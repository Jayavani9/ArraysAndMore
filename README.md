An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.
1. Solution using Integer.bitCount(n) where it should be equal to 1
2. Using log solution 


1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
