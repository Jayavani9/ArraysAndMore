Write a function that takes a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer as input. 
The function should return a new string where each letter in the input string is shifted by a given number of positions in the alphabet. 
If the shift exceeds the letter 'z', it should wrap around to the letter 'a'.

Sample Input
string = "xyz"
key = 2
    
Sample Output
"zab"
